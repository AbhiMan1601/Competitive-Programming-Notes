# Competitive Programming notes (Python3)

# Preliminary notes (Beginner) 



# When they ask for test cases in beginning 
x = int(input(" "))

for i in range(x):
    (a,b) = map(int,input().split()) # for side by side inputs/you can even use list without brackets like 
     a,b = list(map(int,input().split())) # works for more than 2 inputs too



# Floor Function
x//m # implies x floor m OR

import math

math.floor(a) # implies flooring of a (or any other statement)



# Counting the number of times a function is called
count = 0
while e > 0:
    e = e//k # example (// is floor function)
    count += 1
print(count)

# To print the maximum of two numbers 
print(max(a,b))
